MB-Lab is a complex project that is still only fully understood by
Manuel Bastioni himself. The development of MB-Lab is not only to get
x,y,z feature in but to figure out how it works itself. This part of the
documentation will focus on how to expand MB-Lab as well as reverse
engineer the data and internals.
